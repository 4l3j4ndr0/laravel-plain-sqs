A custom SQS connector for Laravel (or Lumen) that supports custom format JSON payloads. Out of the box, Laravel expects
SQS messages to be generated in specific format - format that includes job handler class and a serialized job.

But in certain cases you may want to parse messages from third party applications, custom JSON messages and so on.
