A custom SQS connector for Laravel (or Lumen) that supports custom format JSON payloads. Out of the box, Laravel expects
SQS messages to be generated in specific format - format that includes job handler class and a serialized job.

But in certain cases you may want to parse messages from third party applications, custom JSON messages and so on.

## Dependencies

* PHP >= 5.5
* Laravel (or Lumen) >= 5.2

## Installation via Composer

To install simply run:

```
composer require dusterio/plainsqs
```

Or add it to `composer.json` manually:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "dusterio/plainsqs": "~0.1"
    }
}
```

## Direct usage

```php
```

**Output**

```
```

### Usage in Laravel 5

```php
// Add in your config/app.php

'providers' => [
    '...',
    'Dusterio\PlainSqs\Integrations\LaravelServiceProvider',
];
```

## Todo

1. Add more unit and integration tests
